When suggesting database changes, always create proper migrations rather than direct schema modifications.
Use the date as the migration prefix. Se existing migration prefix for pattern and date format (yyyymmdd).
Always use `supabase migration up` instead of `supabase db push` when creating or applying new database migrations.
